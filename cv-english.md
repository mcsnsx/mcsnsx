## 👩‍💻 About Me

Knowledge is key, I've always been very open to learning new things, reading and learning since forever! My focus in life has always been to study and strive to achieve my goals, as well as to **evolve personally and professionally**.

I've never had problems transitioning to new things, I see it as a challenge and that motivates me. I've had different professional experiences, which has allowed me to create a vast repertoire and become **highly adaptable**, persistent, and very hungry for new experiences. After going through a career transition, I've been in the Technology field since the end of 2021.
